       <p> The place I chose to depict is New York City, specifically a rushed morning in the city. I chose this because it interests me, and I believe many people can relate to it. Once you hear the sounds, you can instantly recognize that it's New York. I wanted to capture the feeling of getting ready to go to work or college, but I focused more on the city sounds, such as birds, footsteps, train ambience, and more. The idea is that you are rushing because you are late. The most challenging part for me was figuring out how to edit the audio and what effects to use. However, after reviewing the PowerPoint slides and tutorials, I was able to figure it out. I used fade-ins and fade-outs and combined different audio clips to match the mood I wanted and blend everything with the background music.</p>
