       <p> I chose these images because when I travel, especially to places where I’m from, I enjoy capturing moments through photos. It represents who I am since I love taking pictures of everything around me. It brings me joy to collect these memories and keep them in a journal so I can look back on them. It’s fun and meaningful. I arranged the images to resemble a journal layout. Masking everything together was a bit difficult, so I decided to photograph and mask each element separately. This made it easier for me to edit and combine them with the other layers.

The colors I used were either my personal favorites or ones I felt matched my personality. I created a gingham print for the background because I really like that pattern. One of the more challenging parts was deciding which shapes to use, how I wanted everything to look, and where to place the elements. In the end, I positioned things based on what felt right and aimed to make it visually appealing, especially since this was my first time creating something like this.</p>
