        <p>I chose to represent the emotion of sadness and designed the characters as simple square shapes. Using shapes felt more manageable for me to animate. One of the more challenging parts was getting the timing right as the squares passed the ball back and forth because I was aiming for a specific speed. What helped was dragging the keyframes and using Easy Ease to create smoother, less stiff transitions. I picked those particular colors because they reminded me of a childlike TV cartoon style, and I felt they matched the overall aesthetic I was going for.</p>
